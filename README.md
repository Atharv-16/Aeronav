## Introduction

Welcome to the Drone Autonomous Navigation and Image Processing project! This project focuses on developing a Python-based wrapper and controller for enabling autonomous navigation of a drone within a simulated environment. It also incorporates image processing techniques using OpenCV to extract valuable information from images captured by the drone's camera.

## Project Details

The project includes the following key components and features:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The Python wrapper and controller facilitate autonomous navigation of the drone, allowing it to move within a simulated environment with minimal human intervention.

- **Image Processing with OpenCV**: OpenCV is used to process images captured by the drone's camera. Various image processing techniques are applied to achieve tasks like object counting, color distinction, and shape recognition.

For more detailed technical information, please refer to the project's code within this repository.
